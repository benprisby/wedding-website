        <h2 class="major">Our Story</h2>
        <span class="image main"><img src="images/our-story-1.webp" loading="lazy" alt="" /></span>
        <p>As two people who spend many nights conversing about life's unique circumstances that brought them to where
          they are, our origin story has always been a special embodiment of just that. Two people came together on a
          night that was likely to have never occurred, yet resulted in sharing more similarities than each thought
          possible.</p>
        <p>The story begins on September 17, 2022 in a drunken haze on the fine fields of the Xfinity Center in
          Mansfield, where each of us arrived with our independent friend groups for a country concert and sought out a
          place to camp for the show. From there, things got interesting.</p>
        <h3>Ben's Side</h3>
        <p>After an initial spot on the lawn being inundated with teenagers, the young geezer I am urged the group to
          move somewhere else. After pacing a few tens of yards over to a new area, I laid down a blanket only to find
          Sam looking at me precisely as I looked back up. Her eyes were full of curiosity and I immediately felt
          something new awaken inside me. As I scrambled to come up with something better than "hi," she beat me to it
          with "are you of age?"</p>
        <p>Immediately I laughed and with the ice broken, the conversation built into discovering we both arrived at the
          concert on a whim, have the same exact birthday, and both enjoy classic rock. I was convinced one of my
          friends had a radio in her ear feeding her answers and she was convinced I was lying about my birthday (which
          I confirmed by showing her my license, a real first in dating). I knew in that moment and I still know today
          that although we met for the first time that night, I had known her for a lifetime.</p>
        <p>Following through on a hazy first date suggestion on a Somerville bar hop two weeks later, we were thrilled
          to skip favorite colors and get straight into philosophy, relationships, and personal goals. As one hour
          turned into several, Sam connected with me in a way so genuine and natural, it is still hard to articulate.
          Every mental model I had about dating was shattered in the most beautiful way and I knew this was something I
          could not let go, drifting in time and space.</p>
        <p>Our similar sense of humor carried us through many of the dates that followed. From gluing her heel back
          together in the Prudential Center on the way to the Beehive to all of the low-hanging fruit Italian and
          Portuguese jokes, our connection grew deeper. I knew from the second date when she walked out of her Brighton
          apartment that I loved her and that love has only continued to grow. The white rose I gave to her that night
          to symbolize hope has certainly paid off!</p>
        <p>From then to now, Sam embodies all that is good in the world. She is beautiful, strong, intelligent, curious,
          loving, and dedicated, just to name a few. She has made me a better man and has opened my eyes to a future I
          did not think I would find. She is a constant inspiration to me to continue loving, growing, and challenging
          the status quo. It is truly a love I am honored to hold.</p>
        <h3>Sam's Side</h3>
        <p>Although Ben might deny it, everything about that day felt like fate. To the last-minute tickets to a walk
          with a stranger, I laid eyes on Ben the second he stopped to put his blanket down. I saw the hair first; the
          rest was history.</p>
        <p>I was just trying to make friends for the sake of a fun night and approached the man with the best hair in
          the Levi jacket. Through the drunken haze while surrounded by families and teens, I mustered up a pickup line,
          "Are you of age?" With a laugh that has now become my favorite sound, I was surprised to find out that not
          only was he also 25 but we shared the same birthday. See, fate. We talked all night and shared a kiss and
          something inside of me ignited.</p>
        <p>Our first date was delayed because Ben had a cold (that I gave him). The wait was worth the rest of my life.
          That night felt as if I was talking to someone who had known me in another life. I was captivated by every
          word he said. Moved by his experiences that felt so familiar. In awe that this man was walking the Earth so
          close to me and I had not realized. Falling in love with Ben was easy; it felt like going home.</p>
        <p>The second date came and it was truly a fairy tale. I snapped my heel and I remember him supergluing it
          together on a bench in the Prudential Center. We spent the night with cocktails, soft music, and so much
          laughter. There was nothing we couldn't talk about with ease. When I went home I declared to all, "I had the
          best night with my husband!"</p>
        <p>It was truly easy falling in love with Ben. He is everything I hope for in humanity: kind, smart, empathetic,
          thoughtful, driven, and intentional. He makes the world better by being in it. I felt like my soul has always
          known his soul, now, in another life and beyond. He is home, and I feel so fortunate to have such a love as
          this. A love that is fate.</p>

        <h2 class="major">Celebration</h2>
        <p>While we have decided to privately elope for our wedding ceremony, we are beyond excited to welcome our
          closest friends and family to a relaxing night of fantastic Italian food, drink, and dessert at a place very
          meaningful to us in the city in which we cemented our love.</p>

        <p><i>Semi-Formal Attire</i></p>
        <p>We chose Capo because of its incredible mastery of Italian food in an environment that feels very aligned to
          who we are and where we enjoy spending time. The dining room features a beautiful fireplace and plenty of
          space to roam, mingle, and eat. And above all else, we want the night to be laid back and focused simply on
          celebrating our connections with all of you over excellent food.</p>
        <p>We will be serving a variety of charcuterie, small bites, fresh pasta, proteins, and of course desserts that
          we assure will not disappoint. Please let us know of any dietary restrictions via <a href="#rsvp">RSVP</a> so
          we can accommodate in finalizing our selections.</p>
        <p>While a photographer will be present documenting the evening in a candid fashion, we will also create a
          shared dropbox for any photos you may wish to upload.</p>
        <p>Please see the <a href="#q-and-a">questions and answers</a> for more information.</p>

        <h3>What is the best way to get to Capo?</h3>
        <p>Those living in or around the city are encouraged to take the T (about a 10 minute walk from the Broadway Red
          Line stop) or Uber/Lyft. Parking around the area is limited, but there are several lots and garages available,
          including <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
            href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/ChargePoint+Charging+Station/@42.3364452,-71.0469068,19.2z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x89e37a897be44bb3:0xa82c78dd8aab5391!8m2!3d42.33639!4d-71.0464!16s%2Fg%2F11pv35_g4v?hl=en&entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDExNS4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D">a
            lot directly across the street from the restaurant</a> (that does fill up quickly) and metered street
          parking. Apps like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://spothero.com">SpotHero</a> can
          be quite handy for reserving a spot in advance. Carpooling is encouraged when/if possible.</p>
        <h3>What time should I arrive?</h3>
        <p><i>5 p.m. on the dot</i>, as we plan to have a couple walk-in, dance, and a toast before starting dinner
          service. Please allow ample transportation time for the inevitable traffic or potential train delays.</p>
        <h3>What is the dress code?</h3>
        <p>We request semi-formal attire (dressy, but comfortable). No jeans, jacket optional for gentlemen.</p>
        <h3>What will the seating arrangement be?</h3>
        <p>There is no assigned seating, but there will be a seat for everyone in a family-style layout. Sit, stand, and
          mingle!</p>
        <h3>What about drinks?</h3>
        <p>A full cash bar will be available featuring a signature cocktail or two.</p>
        <h3>What happens after 8?</h3>
        <p>While we must clear out of the dining room promptly at 8 p.m., we plan on migrating downstairs to the lounge
          for more drinks and dancing before the younger crowd awakens and makes us feel old. We'll see where the night
          takes us!</p>
        <h3>Is there a gift registry?</h3>
        <p>No, but donations to a honeymoon fund are very much appreciated, though certainly not expected. We plan on
          using the fund to get us closer to purchasing our first home. If you do wish to send something our way, we
          will have an envelope box at the event along with a Venmo code.</p>
        <h3>Who took these amazing pictures?</h3>
        <p>Our dear friend Stephen was kind enough to shoot us around Newport, RI, one of our favorite locations. His
          talent is second to none! The background photo is from our summer trip to Portugal, where we were sitting on
          the Douro River in Porto enjoying port wine.</p>
        <h3>Why "Prousa" for this website?</h3>
        <p>It's a portmanteau of our last names that makes us laugh. Careful not to make too much fun of it or we may
          name our kids after it!</p>
